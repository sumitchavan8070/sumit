I started my career as a web developer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} years ago**. I've tried some programming languages and tech stack, both Back-End, and Front-End.

Even though the scope of web development is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Flutter Development** and **UI Design**.

### Flutter

Passionate about Flutter development for its cross-platform capabilities and sleek UI. With two years of dedicated experience, I thrive on harnessing Flutter's advantages to create seamless, dynamic applications. My journey with Flutter reflects a commitment to innovation and a deep appreciation for its efficiency in delivering top-notch user experiences.

But I still like to make simple website pages like **landing pages**. So, what tools did I feel comfortable using during the website creation?

### React

I really enjoy building single page application websites and React is my go-to library.

I've been using it **since 2023 ({2024 - 2023} years)** and have become quite proficient with it.

### Next.js

I've been using CRA for a few years, but since discovering Next.js, I don't think I would want to use any other web framework. **It's just that good!**

## Detail and Summary

I represent all data in labels to make it easier to read. The **underline indicator** shows how often I used the related item, e.g.:
