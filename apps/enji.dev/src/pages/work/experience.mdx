## I started my professional career as a developer around 2022.

## Full-time Work

**Cognus Technology.** (Feb 2022 - Present)

1. Improving the development of some Flutter projects.

My first and (currently) only professional work is at cognus. At cognus, I do many types of work, such as developing mobile applications.

However, my work there is primarily focused on web development, and around the last 2 years I worked there, I have learned a lot about React.

Here are the details of the work I did at Ciptaloka:

- Created the 12 apps using Flutter.
- gained knowledge about React .
- Developed interactive mobile applications using Flutter.
